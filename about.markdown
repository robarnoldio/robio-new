This is my blog about  messing with my stereo. I mainly listen to records, and I've got a relatively substantial [collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/Robarnold/collection). Right now, my gear looks like this:

# Ortofon 2M Bronze

I bought this new at my local record shop in 2023. I replaced a 2M red that went onto my kid's setup. Bronze gets you a nude fine line stylus geometry, which I wanted to get better detail that I was hearing. I have to say the red stacks up pretty damn well against this thing at a quarter of the price though.

# Yamaha YP-800 turntable (1976)

This direct drive turntable comes with a Grace G-840F tonearm, HS-800 aluminum headshell, 2kg die cast aluminum platter, and 12 pole brushless motor. I got this item used for in the neighborhood of $200, though it's difficult to pin down exactly what I paid since I flipped up three other turntables to buy it. Each of those three was a yard sale find for $15 or under.

I gained two main benefits when I upgraded to this deck--I can set the tonearm height, and the speed stability is unbelievably improved. My last daily driver had a lot of wow and was quite distracting when listening to piano solos. This deck comprehensively fixed that.

I have modified the feet, replacing them with a cheap set of spring loaded aluiminum feet from Temu (from that household brand, HHDZI). I drilled holes in these so I could convert them to leveling feet like what I removed. I have the original slipmat, but am using a homemade leather mat for right now (I love the static reduction).

# Yamaha CR-420 Receiver (1977)

This is rated at 22W/channel into 8 ohms, but punches way above its weight. The silverface look is super classic, and this is the bottom of the line that included models CR-620, 820, 1020, 2020, and even the elusive 3020. These are regularly bringing a couple hundred bucks on the used market, but I nabbed mine from a local seller for $40. My good friend Brett teched it up into fine shape and it sounds great.

# Klipsch RF-5 floorstanding speakers (early 2000s)

One key reason I don't need a monster amp, besides my room size, is that these Klipsch speakers are ridiculously efficent at 99dB/W. I put some 3" carriage bolts into the outrigger feet to get these guys up off the carpet. I got these for free from my old boss (thanks, Gary, I love them). My speaker wires are low-cost zip cord style terminated in pin jacks. The receiver has spring loaded clips and the speakers have 4-way binding posts, and this keeps things nice and tidy.

I would love to find a pair of RF-7 (flagships) to replace these, but for now I'm rocking these.
