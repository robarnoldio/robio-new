    <p>I recently went to change the battery in a flashlight that I use daily. To my surprise,
the upper battery had exploded, leaking goo all over the interior of the flashlight, 
cementing itself in place in the process.</p>

<p><img src="/i/IMG_2504.jpg" alt="&quot;my battery blowed up&quot;" title="blowed up battery" /></p>

<p>In order to return this fine flashlight to service, I had to solve the stuck battery.
What wound up doing the trick was distilled vinegar. I shot some vinegar up the tube,
which dissolved the hardened goo. After a few minutes I was able to retrieve the
battery by lightly pounding the tube on a counter top. I then rinsed out the vinegar.</p>

<p>I more calculated that this light was more or less toast, so the risk of getting the 
innards wet didn’t really bother me. I tried to minimize the time the insides were wet,
and I shook excess moisture out (vigorously). Then I let it dry before I put the batteries
back in.</p>

<p>The first attempt failed–there was some chunks of dried goo that blocked the circuit.
Once I got those out of the flashight tube, my light was working again. The battery 
leakage damaged the anodizing on the inside of the tube, but you won’t see that.</p>
